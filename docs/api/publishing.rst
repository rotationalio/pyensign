Publishing
==========

A `Publisher` is responsible for emitting events to a topic stream.

In Ensign, you can create a `Publisher` once you have established a client. On publish, the client checks to see if it has an open publish stream created and if it doesnâ€™t, it opens a stream to the correct Ensign node.
