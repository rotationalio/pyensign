# PyEnsign

PyEnsign is the official Python SDK for [Ensign](https://rotational.io/ensign), a distributed event store and stream-processing platform. This library allows you to interact with the Ensign API directly from Python in order to create [publishers](https://ensign.rotational.dev/eventing/glossary/#publisher) and [suibscribers](https://ensign.rotational.dev/eventing/glossary/#subscriber).
